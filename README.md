# BCI_Team_Gr8

To run our project, first run 'npm install' and then run 'npm start'.

Working features:

-First turn on the Muse headband and then press the connect button on the web app. Now the application is receiving data from the Muse headband.

-The MusicPlayer feature is at the bottom and can run a single .mp3 file, but cannot switch between the two .mp3 files being used to change the users level of stress.

Features that need to be implemented:

-Data from the Muse headband needs to be transformed into a mathematical number for the application to determine which level of stress the user is at.

-The MusicPlayer needs functionality to take in information so that it can switch between .mp3 files dynamically.
